## Whispers of War
#### Game Concept
- Players begin at a low level, and then gain experience over the course of the game to achieve upper levels.
- Players have 5 sets of cards to move, attack, and spell.
- Players attack if an enemy exists within the range of his attack zone.
- The map has different terrain such as river, mountain, swamp, grass, where if the player goes, his range of movement will decrease.
- Each player has a randomly generated luck which represents the probability of dodging an enemyâ€™s attack.
